        <h3 style="margin-left: 15px;">
            Introduction: Personality Prediction System is a system which can be used by company to find right candidate
            with best personality for their organization. It tells us if a human is capable enough to lead, influence
            and communicate effectively with others. The first step of recruitment is the job application which consists
            of personal details, experience, and most importantly CV. Companies typically receive thousands of
            applications per job opening and have a dedicated team of screeners to select qualified candidates. It is
            very difficult for human beings to manually go through the CV of all applicants. Many candidates get
            filtered out in the first round itself on the basis of suitability, improper CV, not being skilled enough.
            Hiring the right candidate is very difficult task as no candidate is perfect, some might not be skilled
            enough or some might not have the right personality. Hence, we created or propose a way in which the process
            of shortlisting gets streamlined and faster by personality prediction.
